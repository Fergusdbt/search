#### Description: A front-end design for a web application replicating Google's various search engines 
#### Command: python manage.py runserver

This is a project submitted as part of Havard University's CS50w online course. 

This web-based application uses just HTML and CSS files to accurately replicate the Google search engine. This includes Google Images and Google Advanced search functionality by populating the URL with arguments appropriately. It also provides Google's "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature to generate a web page at random.
